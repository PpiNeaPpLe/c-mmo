The project will be graded by the following criteria:

Does your project use all of the below C features that we learned in the class?
Pointers

Strings and at least one string function

At least one of Arrays and Linked Lists

At least one of Structs and Unions

If you use Structs, then also use Bitfields

Multiple source files.

Header files.

Make or similar build tools

Command line options and arguments

Environment Variables

malloc() and free()

Variadic Function
Presentation
You will present your program on the lab's instructor computer (the one I've been using).
Before the presentation day, you should have a dry run your presentation on the instructor's computer. That includes running a Linux virtual machine in VirtualBox, compiling and running your program and showing your PPT (if any) on the instructor's computer. As a rule of thumb, there're always some issues for presentation, especially on a new computer. So this is your chance to fix all the issues and make sure you are truly ready for the presentation. Imagine this is a work presentation that you will make to your company's investors! You don't want to mess up anything and show the lack of professionalism.
During the presentation, you must compile your code via make or similar build tool, and run your C program through to demonstrate how users would use your program. Feel free to show a PPT but it's not required.
You then need to run valgrind on your program to show that there's 0 memory leak.
You then need to show your source code and demonstrate the use of the required C features listed above.
You will lose points if there's any required features not used, or you run into any issues in the demo (that's why you need the dry run), or there're memory leaks.
Here are the detailed grading critera (total is 100 points)
Code must compile and run during presentation (32 points)
Must include all required features (48 points, 4 points for each feature)
Code must have 0 memory leaks (10 points)
Smooth presentation (10 points, at the discretion of the instructorï¼‰
